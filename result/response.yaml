            The convergence time measured from the data plane perspective only. 
            It measures the time from BTT, when the rate on Test Port 2 crosses 
            below the Rx Threshold until an acceptable amount of traffic was 
            received at time ATT, when the rate crosses above the configured 
            rx_rate_threshold.

            The total convergence time, between the event that caused the
            switchover (at tEvent) until an acceptable amount of traffic was 
            received at time ATT, when the rate crosses above the configured 
            rx_rate_threshold.
